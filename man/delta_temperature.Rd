\description{
The 1979-2000 rearing temperature in the North and South Delta in Â°C
}
\details{
Water temperature in the Deltas were modeled as a function of air temperature.

North Delta was modeled using a sample of recent measured water temperature at
CDEC station \href{http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/staMeta?station_id=EMM}{EMM}
and NOAA CDO air temperature data from \href{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GSOM/stations/GHCND:USC00040232/detail}{Antioch}.

The North Delta is defined as the area west of and including the Sacramento River below Freeport to Chips Island.

South Delta was modeled using a sample of recent measured water temperature at
CDEC station \href{http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/staMeta?station_id=MTB}{MTB}
and NOAA CDO air temperature data \href{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GSOM/stations/GHCND:USW00023237/detail}{Stockton Airport}.

The South Delta is defined as the area east of the Sacramento River below Freeport to Chips Island and the San Joaquin River
below Vernalis.
