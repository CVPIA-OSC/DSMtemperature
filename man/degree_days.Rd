\description{
A named list containing the monthly accumulated degree days Â°C.
Each named list element is a temperature datasets of Hec5q and other modeled temps corresponding to 2008-2009 and 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp runs.

The named list components are:
\itemize{
    \item{biop_2008_2009: degree days for watersheds from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.}
    \item{biop_itp_2018_2019: degree days for watersheds from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp & ITP run.}
}
}
\details{
For watersheds with HEC-5Q modeled results, the calculation for degree days
is the sum of the daily mean values for each month.

For the other regions, the calculation for degree days is the monthly mean
temperature multiplied by the number of days in the month.
