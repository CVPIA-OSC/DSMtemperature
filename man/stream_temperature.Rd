\description{
A named list containing the 1980-2000 monthly mean water temperatures in Â°C.
Each named list element is a temperature datasets of Hec5q and other modeled temps corresponding to 2008-2009 and 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp runs.

The named list components are:
\itemize{
    \item{biop_2008_2009: monthly stream temperature in degrees C for watersheds from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.}
    \item{biop_itp_2018_2019: monthly stream temperature in degrees C for watersheds from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp & ITP run.}
    \item{run_of_river: monthly stream temperature in degrees C for watersheds from the Run of River Calsim run.}
}
}
\details{
The following four methods were used to estimate the monthly mean water
temperature for the watersheds during 1979-1999:


\strong{HEC-5Q} \cr
Temperature assignments were determined by Mike Wright using the input files
for the three HEC-5Q runs, i.e. AR_5QCS.dat and AR_5Q-CL.OUT.


\strong{Empirical Data} \cr
Only the Lower Sacramento had sufficient measured water temperature during
the period of the CVPIA salmon life cycle model. The few missing values were
imputed using \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.1/topics/na.interp}{\code{forecast::na.interp}}.

 \strong{Double Regression Modeling} \cr
 Data from many temperature gauges was collected from several CVPIA watersheds.
 In these watersheds, a double regression technique was employed to predict water
 temperature based on equilibrium temperature and the river mile of interest.
 Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a pool of water would approach if
 left in contact with the air for an infinite time, generally equivalent to the
 air temperature. The results were applied to both watersheds of origin and as
 surrogate data for ungauged watersheds.

\strong{Additional Temperature Modeling} \cr
For streams without major dams, water temperature is highly correlated with air temperature.
For each watershed not included in the HEC-5Q model that had partial water temperature data,
a linear model was fitted to estimate water temperature as a function of air temperature.

Generally, the air temperature record spans both the period of the CVPIA salmon life cycle model
and the complete period of record of available water temperature data. In the
cases where there were missing air temperature values between 1979-1999, we imputed the missing values using
\href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.1/topics/na.interp}{\code{forecast::na.interp}}
in order to have a complete air temperature dataset for water temperature estimation.
